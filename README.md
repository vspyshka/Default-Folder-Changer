# Default-Folder-Changer
PS Script that changes default user folders locations

How to:
Download two files in one folder. Run .cmd file
----
This script will ask you the parent directory, where you want to store the defaults. 
Then it will create new folders under this path (Desktop, Documents, etc.)
And after it will change registry values for defaults.

Enjoy:)
